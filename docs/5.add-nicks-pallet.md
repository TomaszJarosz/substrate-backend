https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/build-application-logic/add-a-pallet/

#### 1. Add node-authorization dependencies

Add dependency to runtime/Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
pallet-node-authorization = { default-features = false, version = "4.0.0-dev", git = "https://github.com/paritytech/substrate.git", branch = "polkadot-v1.0.0" }
```

enable feature:

```toml
[features]
default = ['std']
std = [
    "pallet-node-authorization/std",
]
```

Check that the new dependencies resolve correctly:

```bash
cargo check -p node-template-runtime --release
```
